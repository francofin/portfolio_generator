  // node package manager is an online repo for publishing open source code
  // use https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=command%20line%20prompt to search for npm packages
  // to get to the npm command line utility we type npm init, install, uninstall packages, etc
//   We'll create a package.json file to serve as the manifest for the project. 
//   The information in this file pertains to the metadata of the project and which npm packages are being usedâ€”called dependencies. 
//   The package.json file also serves several other purposes that we'll cover later.
// typing npm install will install dependencies cloned from a repo
// git rm -r --cached node_modules this removes tracking of files we would want ignored
